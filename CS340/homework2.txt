Part D. Process

1. man ps
PS(1)                         Linux User’s Manual                        PS(1)

NAME
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes. If
       you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
       information, use top(1) instead.

       This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:
       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can
       appear. There are some synonymous options, which are functionally
       identical, due to the many standards and ps implementations that this
       ps is compatible with.


2. Process States
R - runnable which means the process has done a context switch and has the kernel.

S - sleeping which means the process is waiting on I/O completion (blocked), a pipe, memory, etc.

T - process has been stopped - sent a SIGSTOP usually with ctrl/z

Z - zombie - a process that has a process image in memory but no context, ie., not swappable.

echo $SHELL - identifies my login shell which is tcsh
/bin/tcsh

3. ps -l
F - the flag field.
S - S field is the state of the process, two most common values are S for Sleeping and R for running
UID - User ID of the process owner
PID - Process ID of each process.
PPID - Parent Process ID. Identifies the parent process that started the process.
C - SPU usage and scheduling information
PRI - stands for priority field, lower the value the higher the value.
NI - stands for nice value
ADDR - Address of the process
SZ - refers to the size field. total number of pages in the process.
WCHAN - Memory address of the event the process
TTY - terminal assigned to your process.
TIME - cumulative execution time of the process in minutes and seconds
CMD - command that was executed.
