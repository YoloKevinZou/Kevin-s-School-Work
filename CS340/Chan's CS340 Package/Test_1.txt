STORY QUESTION -
Children wait to get their gift.  Each child process gets its turn[i] by computing number[i].  A clown has in his hat ???? each ball has a different number, from 1 to 10.  After all children have their turn set, the clown is ???? -are the gifts (there are 10 gifts).  The clown picks a random ball, and gives the gift to the child whose number is the same with the number of the ball (after that, he throws away the selected ball).
Variables:
	turn[] = 0
	number[] = 0
	called[] = 0
	ballsNumber = 10
	i = 1,.......10 (N=10)
child(int i)
{
	number[i] = 1+max(number[1],number[2],....number[N});
	turnpi] = number[i];
	while(!called[i]) {busyWait;}
	getTheGift();		//sleep
	ballsNumber--;
	goHome();		//sleep
}
clown()
{
	while(ballsNumber>0)
	{
		pickABall();			//sleep
		for(int j=1; j<=N; j++)
		{
			if(turn[i]==numberOnBall)
			{
				called[j]=true;
				giveTheGift();	//sleep
			}//if
		}//for
	}//while
	leave;
}//clown

*ALL CHILD PROCESSES EXECUTE CONCURRENTLY.
(A) Is it possible for 2 children to compute the same value for number[i]?  Explain why and give the execution sequence that can show it.
(B) Consider that 6 children already computed their number[i].  Give an execution sequence by which after these 6 children computed their number, the largest computed number[i] = 4.
(C) On the hypothesis that each child has a different number[i], is it possible for children to compete for the same give (because turn[i] values are the same)?  Explain.  If yes, give the execution sequence that will show it.
(D) Consider that at this point, all cihldren have their turn[i] updated (are done with the execution of turn[i]=number[i];) Is it possible for a child to starve (never be called), by busy waiting in the while loop?  Explain.  If yes, give the execution sequence that will show it.
(E) Under the hypothesis that each child had a different turn[i] value and received a gift, is it possible for the clown to not be able to go home because the while condition is still true? Give the sequence that will show this situation.

Extra Credit - 6 points
(Giving the execution sequence) that if TS is not executed automatically, the Mutual Exclusion condition with TS fails to satisfy the condition.  Show where the interrupt should occur.
