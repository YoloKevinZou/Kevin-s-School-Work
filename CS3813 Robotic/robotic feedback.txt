team Moka
first idea: wants to fly
2nd idea: quick delivery using robot, under 500 ft you don't need permission to fly and 500 feet away from over populated dense area.

Question: is the delivery going to be continental wise or just national wise?

what materials will be able for delivery, weight limit?

3rd idea: autonomous spider.

question: Are you going to give a location for the spider to move to?

how are you guys planning to do the input for the spider? is it going to be through an android app or something else?
