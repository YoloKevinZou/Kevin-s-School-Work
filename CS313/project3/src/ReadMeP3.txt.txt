1. Read pages 157-160

2. Define "Concordance".

	Concordance is a list of words that appear in a text document along with the numbers of the lines on which the words appear. 
	it is just like an index of a book except that it lists line numbers instead of page numbers. Concordances are useful for 
	analyzing documents to find word frequencies and associations that are not evident from reading the document directly.

3. Research and explain 2 additional concordances.
	
	Example 1 - Concordance is used in finding word in browsers where when you typed in the words that you are looking for in a 
		    certain page, it will display the number of words that are equivalent to the one that you are looking for.
	
	Example 2 - MonoConc Pro, a fast text searching program. It is used in the analysis of English or other texts, 
		    Spanish, French Japanese, Chinese, etc for linguistic or language teaching and language learning purposes (ESL).


4. Explain the differences between using a HashMap and a TreeMap.

	HashMap is better for fast lookup however it does not sort the values in the map.
	TreeMap sorts the values in the map into alphabetical orders.
