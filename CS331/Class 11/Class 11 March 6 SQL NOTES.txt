Question: How to add a new column to a 
previously created table?

ADD ZIPCODE TO CUSTOMERS

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
ADD COLUMN CZIPCODE CHAR(5);



sQL> ONE COLUMN ADDED

update customers
set czipcode = '30456'
where  cfirst = 'Bob'
and clast = 'Jones' and cid = 902 ;



Modify a previously created column:

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
modify COLUMN CZIPCODE CHAR(9);


Rename a previously created column:

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
RENAME COLUMN CZIPCODE TO ZIP_CODE;

------------------------------

OBJECTIVE: CREATE A COPY OF A PREVIOUSLY
CREATED TABLE.


CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS2
AS SELECT * 
   FROM CUSTOMERS;

---------------------

Then you can modify and test the 
copy table rather than the original 
table.


UPDATE CUSTOMERS2
SET CZIPCODE = '1136a'
WHERE CITY = 'CHICAGO' AND line1 = '1414 MAIN STREET'

domain of zipcode 0-9

11111
00001

SELECT * 
FROM CUSTOMERS;
